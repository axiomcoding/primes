# Primes
Define a method, `prime?`, that determines whether a number is prime or not. Then, using that method, define a method, `all_primes` that returns all of the prime numbers from 1 to the number input inside an array.   

Remember, a prime number is a whole number greater than 0 whose only 2 factors are 1 and itself. In other words, any number that can only be even divided by 1 and itself (i.e. 5, 17, 37, etc.)
